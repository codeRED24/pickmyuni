                    Do I need work experience to apply for PR after studying in
                    Australia?

                    Yes, most PR pathways require relevant work experience. The
                    amount varies by occupation - typically 1-3 years of skilled
                    work experience in your field of study. Some occupations may
                    have specific requirements, so it's important to check the
                    current skilled occupation lists.

                    Yes, trade courses are excellent for PR in Australia.
